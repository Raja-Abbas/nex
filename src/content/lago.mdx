# Lago on NexLayer is here!

# The programmable API for usage-based billing

**Open Source Metering & Usage-Based Billing**

The best alternative to Chargebee, Recurly, or Stripe Billing.
For usage-based, subscription-based, and all the nuances of pricing in between.

## The Solution: Lago, the open-source billing API for product-led SaaS

- **Event-based:** If you can track it, you can charge for it.
- **Built for product-led growth companies.**
- **Hybrid pricing:** Subscription and usage.
- **Hybrid go-to-market motion:** Self-serve and sales-led.

## Open-source, open architecture:

- **Composable:** Connect Lago to any of your internal systems or tools (e.g., any payment gateway, CRM, CPQ, accounting software).
- **Pricing:** We’re not rent seekers; our self-hosted version is free, and our cloud version is priced like a SaaS.
- **Privacy:** Your data never has to leave your infrastructure.
