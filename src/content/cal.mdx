# Scheduling infrastructure for absolutely everyone

The open source Calendly successor. You are in charge of your own data, workflow, and appearance.

Calendly and other scheduling tools are awesome. They make our lives massively easier. We use them for business meetings, seminars, yoga classes, and even calls with our families. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control and customization.

That's where **Cal.com** comes inâ€”self-hosted or hosted by us. White-label by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain, giving you full control of your events and data.
